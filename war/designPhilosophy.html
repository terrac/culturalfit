			<h1>Culture Fit Philosophy</h1>

		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Culture fit tries to solve a specific problem. That problem
				is, how do I explain to someone that you are good at what you do if
				they don't know how to evaluate that?</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>The answer is that you don't. You look to a
				respected third party that can give you good data, in this case
				Culture Fit</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>Culture Fit should provide enough information to
				decide if someone is worth interviewing. Its goal is to say assuming
				this person is honest then there is a pretty good chance they know
				what they are doing.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>Additionally there are also questions about different hobbies
				so you can focus on people that are a good team fit.</p>
		</div>
